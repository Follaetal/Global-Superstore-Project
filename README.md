### Introduction
#### Project Overview
Global Superstore is a global online retailer based in New York, boasting a broad product catalog and aiming to be a one-stop-shop for its customers. Global The superstoreâ€™s clientele, hailing from 147 different countries, can browse through an endless offering with more than 10,000 products. This large selection comprises three main categories: office supplies (e.g., staples), furniture (e.g., chairs), and technology (e.g., smartphones). This dataset comprises of sales data over a period of 4 years. From 2011 to 2014. There are details about eacg other such as; Segment, Ship mode, order priority, region, city etc. This project focuses on the general performance for these 4 years but with more emphasis on the year 2014.

#### Objective
The purpose of this project is to explore the data of the Superstore in order to give insights on the progress of sales and propose solutions to reduce loss especially in regions with high deficit. There so many factors that could be responsible for the discoveries, therefore, the objective of this project is to identify:
- products, regions, countries and cities with the high and low profits
- sub-categories and their average shipping costs
- factors responsible for Nigeria's performance in comparison to other african countries
- least profitable sub-category in Southeast Asia
- Profitable cities in the USA
- the most valuable customers and their purchases.

#### Tools
Microsoft Power BI (Data analysis and visualization)
GitHub (documentation)

#### Analysis
Firstly, it is important to identify the most and least profitable countries and what the profit values are.

China, India and The USA were the top 3 most profitable countries. 

In these countries the top 3 most profitable products are as follows:

In comparison to other african countries, Nigeria's experienced more loss than others. The shipping costs and average discount of the country are the factors that could be linked to this high loss in the data.

Southasia comprises oof seven countries and the profitablity was analysed by the sub-category of the products sold. in addition, we also have the analysis of the cities in the united states in order to identify the least profitable city.

Lastly, Australia was also analysed according to the sub-category of products.

The sales of products didn't guarantee profit due to factors like shipping costs and high discount rates just like in the case of Nigeria. However, there are some customers and products who brought in more profit than the rest.

#### Insights
- In this analysis, it is evident that there are some products that were sold in large numbers but did not bring in so much profit such as supplies, paper, envelopes, labels, furnishings, art, fasteners and accessories.
- Countries with high discount rates suffer more loss than others.
-The population of countries contribute to the profitability.
- Appliances and phones bring most of the profit in the superstore.
- High cost of shipping reduce profit and in most cases, causes loss.
- Southeast Asia have experienced more loss that most regions.

  #### Recommendations
  Generally, it is evident that the superstore is making impressive sales, however, there are some regions that need reform in the shipping costs and discount rate as these are the major factors that increases cost for the superstore. In addition, other recommendations are:
  - Reduction of sales of sub-categories that are not profitable. This is because, at the long run, they cause more loss for the superstore.
  - Improved quality and marketing for high profit products in order to cushion the effect of the loss the store has experienced
  - Countries and cities with the more loss need reform and possibly customer and staff survey to determine underlying factors that were not documented.
  - There is also a need to introduce more products in high demand such as body and skin care, cosmestics and other products that can influence consistent sales.


    #### Limitations
    In this dataset, the cost price of each product was not documented. This was an inconvenience due to the inability to properly determine the proft margin of the products sold. Therefore, the cause of the losses cannot be properly determined. However, I was able to draw actionable insights from the factors available and proper application of these insights will result in better performance.
